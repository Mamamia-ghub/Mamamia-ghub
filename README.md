## Hi there 👋


🔭 I’m currently working on creating 2D games.

🌱 I’m learning Unity (C# & C++), Blender (3D design), and storyboarding/storytelling to improve my game creation skills.

🤔 I’m looking for guidance on deepening my coding skills and mastering complex systems.

💬 Ask me about my projects, game development process, or indie game creation.

😄 Pronouns: She/Her

⚡ Fun fact: I specialize in 2D game design but can adapt to any type of design creation, from art to mechanics.
